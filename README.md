# Simple Cloud Drive Application

This is my very first Django application that allows you create public or private markdowns or upload files.
<br>


 - *You can add view limit or expiration date to your sharings.*
 - *Markdown edits and additional private tokens can only created by admin user, at least for now.*  
 - *There could be a few bugs, actually there is :D That's all I can do in a short time for practicing Django fundamentals.*
